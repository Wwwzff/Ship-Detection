* This folder is used to contain our applications utilized for the ship detection program

* The other file is what I'm currently working on, which uses flask with javascript and html to set up website. This work is modified on another project on the github, with link showed below:

# C#Application
* This appliacation is functional though, with input image overview and processing log output, tested on a 2-class classification model which works perfectly well. However this version can't be deployed or has great difficulty to be deployed, and thus it's abandoned in the end.
* Coded by Visual Studio 2017, and you may need that to run the .sln file (or just go to ./WindowsFormsApp1/bin/Debug and try to run .exe file directly)

# Python Application
* You may need to modify the model's path in app.py. After running the python script, go have fun in http://localhost:5000 or http://127.0.0.1:5000
