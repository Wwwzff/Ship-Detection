## Introduction
- This project is designed for the Airbus Ship Detection Challenge(reference link:https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbus-ship-detection)
- Backstory
  Shipping traffic is growing fast. More ships increase the chances of infractions at sea like environmentally devastating ship accidents, piracy, illegal fishing, drug trafficking, and illegal cargo movement. This has compelled many organizations, from environmental protection agencies to insurance companies and national government authorities, to have a closer watch over the open seas.

- Use Unet to detect ship in a Satellite Picture dataset offered by Kaggle. 
- Methods are specially modified to fit the time limit on Kaggle notebook.
